## Hey you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a girl who loves to code while watching an episode of Chi's Sweet Home in my break times, get to know me here: 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my problem resolution skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (hey that's fun), english, arabic and spanish.
- ðŸ‘¯ Maybe we can collaborate in the future, I will be happy to work with you!
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for someone who can help me when I need it and give me code feedback (humans mentors are always better than AI)
- ðŸ’¬ If you're a student too, come talk with me, let's share our stuggles and successes!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: There's my Exercism user name -> NekoNeko
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she / her / them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I discovered my passion by playing video games in my nintendo switch

--> Coding is the best way to express who you are to the world, beginning with print(Hello, World!). Keep your journey to your dreams!
